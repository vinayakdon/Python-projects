# üßÆ Advanced Calculator (Python CLI)

The **Advanced Calculator** is a Python-based command-line application designed to perform a wide range of mathematical operations ‚Äî from basic arithmetic to advanced functions. What makes this calculator stand out is its ability to **log and store your calculation history** using Python‚Äôs file handling features. This makes it ideal for users who want a lightweight, offline tool that not only performs calculations but also tracks them for future reference.

This project is a great example of how Python can be used to create practical, real-world tools using core programming concepts like functions, control flow, loops, and file management.
