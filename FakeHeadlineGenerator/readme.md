# 📰 Fake Headline Generator (Python CLI)

The **Fake Headline Generator** is a fun and creative Python-based command-line application that automatically generates **random fake news headlines**. Designed as a lighthearted project, it uses simple text handling techniques to combine phrases and buzzwords into realistic (but fake!) headlines. It's a great example of how Python can be used for string manipulation, randomness, and basic file management.

This project demonstrates how creative logic and programming can be blended together to create engaging, text-based applications.
